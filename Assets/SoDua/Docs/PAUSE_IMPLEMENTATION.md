# Pause System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the pause system in the game.

## Overview

The pause system allows players to pause the game at any time by pressing the ESC key or clicking a pause button in the UI. When paused, the game:

1. Stops time (Time.timeScale = 0)
2. Displays a pause menu overlay
3. Preserves the current game state to return to when unpaused
4. Allows for resuming gameplay or navigating to other menus

## Implementation Details

### 1. GameManagerController

The `GameManagerController` class has been updated with the following additions:

- New fields to track pause state and remember the previous game state
- Methods to toggle, pause, and resume the game:
  - `TogglePauseGame()`
  - `PauseGame()`
  - `ResumeGame()`
- ESC key detection in the Update method to allow keyboard pausing

### 2. UIManager

The `UIManager` class has been updated to:

- Include the pause panel in the panels list
- Handle the PAUSE state in the GameStateChangedCallback method
- Skip the pause panel in the ShowPanel method to allow it to overlay other panels
- Implement ShowPausePanel and HidePausePanel methods

### 3. UI Button Scripts

Two new scripts have been created for UI buttons:

- `PauseButton.cs`: Attach to a button in the game UI to pause the game
- `ResumeButton.cs`: Attach to a button in the pause panel to resume the game

## How to Use

### 1. Setting Up the Pause Panel

1. Create a new UI panel for the pause menu with components like:

   - Resume button (attach ResumeButton.cs)
   - Options button (if applicable)
   - Main menu button (if applicable)
   - Other UI elements (title, background, etc.)

2. Assign the panel to the `pausePanel` field in the UIManager component

### 2. Setting Up the Pause Button

1. Add a pause button to your game UI (typically in the corner of the screen)
2. Attach the PauseButton.cs script to this button

### 3. Testing

Make sure to test the pause functionality:

- Press ESC to pause/unpause
- Click the pause button to pause
- Click the resume button to resume
- Verify that time stops when paused (animations freeze)
- Check that the correct UI panels are shown/hidden

## Additional Considerations

1. **Audio**: Consider muting or lowering audio volume when paused
2. **Particle Effects**: Some particle systems may need special handling when paused
3. **Multiplayer**: In multiplayer games, pausing would need to be handled differently
4. **Save/Load**: The pause menu could be a good place to add save/load options
