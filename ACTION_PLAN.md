# ACTION_PLAN: Implement CharacterController for Player Character

## OBJECTIVE

Modify the existing player control system to use Unity's CharacterController component instead of the current Rigidbody2D-based movement system.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

- [ ] Player movement uses CharacterController instead of Rigidbody2D
- [ ] Player maintains proper collision detection and response
- [ ] Player movement boundaries are preserved
- [ ] Player movement maintains compatibility with the existing input system
- [ ] Character Controller properly integrates with the existing Player class

## ANALYSIS

### Current System:

1. Currently, the player movement is handled by `PlayerController.cs`, which uses a Rigidbody2D component
2. Movement input comes from both the new Input System and potentially a mobile joystick
3. Movement is applied via Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity in FixedUpdate
4. The Player class is separate from PlayerController and handles health, level, and other player state data
5. The game uses a 2D environment with boundaries defined by minX, maxX, minY, maxY

### Challenge Points:

1. CharacterController is designed for 3D environments, while this is a 2D game
2. Need to ensure proper integration with existing systems
3. Must preserve existing game boundaries and collision behavior

## TASKS

### STAGE 1: Implementation Preparation

- [ ] **TASK 1.1:** Create a backup of the existing PlayerController.cs
- [ ] **TASK 1.2:** Modify Player class to add the CharacterController requirement
- [ ] **TASK 1.3:** Create a new PlayerMovement class that will use CharacterController

### STAGE 2: Implement CharacterController Movement

- [ ] **TASK 2.1:** Add CharacterController to Player prefab/GameObject
- [ ] **TASK 2.2:** Implement basic movement with CharacterController
- [ ] **TASK 2.3:** Integrate movement boundaries and constraints
- [ ] **TASK 2.4:** Connect input system to the new movement system

### STAGE 3: Integration and Cleanup

- [ ] **TASK 3.1:** Ensure existing references to player movement still work
- [ ] **TASK 3.2:** Handle the transition from Rigidbody2D to CharacterController
- [ ] **TASK 3.3:** Deactivate or remove the Rigidbody2D component if no longer needed
- [ ] **TASK 3.4:** Test and verify all movement functionality

### STAGE 4: Optimization and Finalization

- [ ] **TASK 4.1:** Ensure the CharacterController component is properly configured
- [ ] **TASK 4.2:** Optimize movement code for performance
- [ ] **TASK 4.3:** Update any documentation or comments

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Key Changes:

1. Add `CharacterController` component and dependency to the Player class
2. Replace Rigidbody2D movement with CharacterController.Move() function
3. Preserve boundary checking but implement it for CharacterController
4. Ensure the input system works with the new movement implementation

### Technical Notes:

- Unity's CharacterController is typically used for 3D, but can be adapted for 2D by constraining movement
- CharacterController uses Move() or SimpleMove() instead of velocity-based movement
- CharacterController provides automatic collision detection and handling
- We'll need to maintain the same references that exist in the current system so other components work correctly
